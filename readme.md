## P4: Final Project  - Flavio Pereira

### Goals of this project:

This project is open-ended. Whatever you create, the main expectation is that the project meets the following criteria:

1. Uses PHP/Laravel.
2. Uses a database with at least 2 tables. This count does not include a users table, but does include pivot tables.
3. Demonstrates all 4 CRUD interactions (user signup/login does not count towards this).

If you started this course at a more advanced level and your confidence in the material is high, you are encouraged to create an app of your choosing. The sky is the limit.

### Project Name:  My Recipe Book! 

Welcome to My Recipe Book! Here you can register all your recipes and easily access them when you need. You can divide your recipes in books and then create all your recipes under your favorite book.

History: My wife has a recipe blog and I decided to build something that she can use as feature in her blog. This is the original blog: http://claudiasrecipe.blogspot.com/

### Final Considerations

Despite my lack of knowledge in programing, I think I did a good job trying to create this application. Like I said in P1, I was up for the challenge. I really enjoyed Laravel and how it make the integration with databases easy. I'm sure will keep working with that on the future in order to improve the blog.

Thank you Susan and all the TA's, in special Jeremy who helped me a lot during this class.
