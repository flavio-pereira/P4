                <p> All my family cooks very well – and this is already a big encouragement to me – 
                but my interest in learning how to cook started around the age of ten, inspired by a chocolate craving.
                So, the first recipe I learned was Brazilian Chocolate Candy (Brigadeiro), a traditional birthday candy from Brazil, 
                which is also the first recipe in this blog. Ever since, my passion for food and will to learn has grown and this
                site is a big proof of that. </p>

                <p>Lucky for me, both of my grandmothers cooked very well, each with their different recipes and secrets. 
                Beef Stew was Mrs. Raimunda's specialty, my paternal grandmother, and until today, I have never tasted any better one.
                 My mother is getting there and I 'm just crawling in the preparation of the dish, which is one of my favorites!

                <p>If you like, sprinkle mozzarella or parmesan cheese before you bake. 
                To remove the stems of the mushrooms, just rotate them and they will come out easily. 
                Be creative and invent new stuffings: ground beef, olives, tomato, shredded chicken breast, 
                cream cheese, turkey breast, corn, cheddar, chives...</p>

                <p>Is hard to imagine someone who does not like brigadeiro in Brazil, specially if you are kid… I have always liked… a lot! 
                When I was a kid, I would ask my mom to make it for me and, after a while, I begin to ask my big sister. 
                I then realized that, if I learned the recipe, I could prepare by myself, whenever I like (or when my mom allowed, 
                better saying). Brigadeiro was the very first recipe I cook in my life and, from this recipe, my passion for cooking began. 
                For this reason, brigadeiro’s recipe was chosen to inaugurate this blog!</p>
